							<h2 style = 'text-align:center'>WELCOME TO MY PAGE</h2>
							<p>Hi! I am Michael, currently a Data Science Master candidate at Duke University. I was born in Chengdu, China, but I move to Toronto, Canada at 14. I have a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering, and I have previously spent over a year working in the healthcare space. It was at that time I learned the power of big data and have decided to become a Data Scientist. Feel free to read more about my transition to Data science in my <a href="https://michaeltang101.medium.com/my-journey-to-data-science-part-i-fe52f1587d2e?source=your_stories_page">Medium blog post</a>.</p>

							<p>I am passionate about exploring the interaction between data and technology, and utilizing data-driven techniques to uncover and understand patterns, and ultimately translating them into organic insights that could enhance decision-making processes! Furthermore, I am interested in experiences that are collaborative, fast-paced, and cultivating. Because of my background in healthcare, I am excited about scalable data solutions that are also socially meaningful.</p>

							<p>On the personal end, I love bouldering and working out, I find them very effective at relieving my stress and improving my focus. I also enjoy cooking and I am a big foodie. Having lived in a diverse city like Toronto, I have the fortune to try some fo the most authentic exotic cuisines.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Apple Covid-19 Dashboard</h3>
											<p>Apple has been actively supporting the mitigation of the spread of COVID-19 global pandemic. It publishes a daily COVID-19 Mobility Trends Report through data it collects from Apple Maps. And I developed a dashboard web application to help improve the mobility data's interactivity and interpretability.</p>
											<p>This web application is built using Plotly Dash framework. Both the frontend and backend operate entirely on a serverless data pipeline. My dashboard is currently deployed on AWS.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Duke Datathon 2020</h3>
											<p>With the continuous outbreak of COVID-19 around the world, many health experts believe that the pandemic will not end in 2021, and the cease of the pandemic will likely involve a mix of efforts. I partnered with 3 otehr graduate-level students to provide a comprehensive analysis and concrete data-driven recommendations on the devastating long-term economic implications of COVID-19. </p>
											<p>Our team leveraged population, economic and Covid-19 specific data to predict the impact on key economic indicators.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Breast Cancer Mass Lesion Analysis</h3>
											<p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States, it is highly desired to detect and introduce intervention in the early stage to prevent further complications. Therefore, there has been a high demand in utilizing machine learning on mammography data to assist diagnosis. This analysis aims to determine the effects that a breast lesion’s physical attributes have on a lesion’s severity. </p>
											<p>My final findings suggest that there are significant relationships between the odds of developing a malignant breast lesion and BI-RADS score, its mass shape and mass margin, as well as patient age, which has the strongest association with malignancy.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/MTang0728/AWS-BrandTrend-webapp" class="image"><img src="images/branding.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">AWS Brand Trend Web App</h3>
											<p>In this project, I built a simple interface that provides daily trend updates on brands through plots and tables. The brands shown in our webapp are updated on a daily basis and could range from fashion apparels to consumer electronics. The goal is to conduct a simple trend analysis by looking at if a sale would affect the brand's popularity on the web. These brands are being searched everyday on Google, whose popularity can be quantified and visualized on Google Trends. </p>
											<p>The webapp is built using Flask application and ran on the principle of a Serverless Data Pipeline. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics 2020 Case Competition</h3>
											<p> The ever growing number of health-threatening substances and sites makes it harder for the medicare industry to evaluate health and its cost. Among all those challenges to health, transportation challenge stands out to be the most common one. </p>
											<p>I joined the Humana-Mays Healthcare Analytics Case Competition with 2 other graduate-level students to identify MediCare members who are most likely to experience Transportation Challenges and propose viable solutions.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Kaggle Housing Price Competition</h3>
											<p>The goal of this competition is to predict the housing prices in Ames using the predictors that are real-estate specific. In this analysis, I performed EDA, imputation, categorical feature encoding and feature engineering to prepare the data. </p>
											<p>For regression model, I used both XGBoost and Random Forest regressor. The final result has an error of approximately 14,000 and ranked top 4% on Kaggle at the time of this notebook.</p>
